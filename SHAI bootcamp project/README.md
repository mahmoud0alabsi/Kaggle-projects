<h1> SHAI co. 2022 Bootcamp project </h1>

<p> During my participation in (SHAI 2022 Bootcamp) in the month of October 2022.

I got second place in the competition held during the BootCamp, an error (0.13682) and a difference (0.00164) from the first place, the percentage of error at the first place (0.13518), it was a unique experience from which I learned a lot.

Project steps:

      1- import libraries
      2- import data and discover it
      3- data preprocessing 
      4- dealing with data 
      5- EDA & data engineering
      6- train & select models (LR, DT, RF, XGBoost, GradientBoosting, Ensemble, LazyRegressor)
      7- using pretty libraries said (Lazy predict)
      8- test models

<p> Best Accuresy I have reached = 0.13682 (error) </p>
