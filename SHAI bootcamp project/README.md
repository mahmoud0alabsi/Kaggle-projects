<h1> SHAI co. 2022 Bootcamp project </h1>

<p> During my participation in (SHAI 2022 Bootcamp) in the month of October 2022.

The task was to "Predict House Prices", but the data set was not easy at all, and it needed a lot of effort and work.

I got second place in the competition held during the BootCamp, an error (0.13682) and a difference (0.00164) from the first place, the percentage of error at the first place (0.13518), it was a unique experience from which I learned a lot.

Project steps:

      1- import libraries
      2- import data and discover it
      3- data preprocessing 
      4- dealing with data 
      5- EDA & data engineering
      6- train & select models (LR, DT, RF, XGBoost, GradientBoosting, Ensemble, LazyRegressor)
      7- using pretty libraries said (Lazy predict)
      8- test models

<p> Best Accuresy I have reached = 0.13682 (error) </p>
