<H1>Hello everyone</H1>
<H2> This is End-To-End Gold Price prediction project by (Mahmoud Alabsi)</H2>
<p>In this project, I worked on predicting the price of gold based on (7 features):

        1-SPX (the ratio of the S&P 500 market index to the price of gold)
        2-USO (United States Oil Fund)
        3-SLV (Silver Price)
        4-SLV_per_SPX
        5-SLV_per_USO
        6-GLD_per_SLV
        7-EUR/USD
        
</p>

<H2> Data set</H2>      
<p> I got data set from (kaggle) and it was clean, and I worked this project on (kaggle) </p>
       
<H2> Best Model</H2>      
<p> The best model in this project was (RandomForestRegressor), and after using (Grid search), I trained and selected the best model with best hyperparameter</p>

<H2> Accuracy</H2>
<p> The highest accuracy I got after training = 0.997 (this accuracy was on test set)
        
        
<H3> Approximate time to complete the project (2:30) Hours</H3>
