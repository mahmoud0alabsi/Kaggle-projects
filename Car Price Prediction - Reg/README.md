## Hello everyone in my first End-to-End Machine Learning project
<p>My project predicts car prices, based on a set of features.
   The data was obtained through the (Kaggle)</p>
   
   <h1>Description of the data</h1>
    <p>
       The original data consists of (11914) rows, and (16) columns (features).The Features:
          
          1- Make (Type of car)
          2- Model
          3- Year (manufacturing year)
          4- Engine Fuel Type
          5- Engine Cylinders
          6- Transmission Type
          7- Driven_Wheels
          8- Number of Doors
          9- Market Category
          10- Vehicle Size
          11- Vehicle Style
          12- highway MPG
          13- city mpg
          14- Popularity
          15- Engine HP
          16- MSRP (car price)
  
        But it was modified, as some were deleted and new features were added (feature engineering).
        Features that are added:      
  
          1- MSRP_per_HP
          2- MSRP_per_Cylinder
          3- MSRP_per_City_mpg
  </p>
  
  
  <h1>Project stages</h1>
    <p>
        The project was done in (5) stages:

        1- Data Analysis:
            - Import libraries and data
            - Solving outliers in numerical attributes
            - Get a look on the object(text) attributes and make important edits 
            - Display some plots

        2- Split data to two set (Training set & Test set)

        3- Feature Engineering (Making new attributes)

        4- Encoding & Scaling 

        5- Select and Train Models
  
  The models that i used in projet are {Linear Regression , Decision Tree Regression , Random Forest Regression}
      </p>
      
   <h1>Finally</h1>
      <p>The best result I got was from (Random Forest Regression model)
         So I used it to show some examples and compare the results of the prediction with the target
          , and I got a percentage of validity (accuracy) = 0.999028

</p>

  <h1>At the end</h1>
   <p>
        I want to thank you for reading the project details and reviewing it, and I will be happy if you comment on the project and express your opinion on it, thank you.
