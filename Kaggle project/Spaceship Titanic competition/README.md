<h1> Spaceship Titanic competition </h1>

<p> In this competition, I used many Machine Learning models and Deep Neural Network after import libraries and make data analysis and some EDA. </p>

      Project steps:
  
          1- import libraries
          2- import data and discover it
          3- data preprocessing 
          4- EDA & data engineering
          5- train & select models (LR, DT, RF, XGBoost, GradientBoosting, Ensemble)
          6- using pretty libraries said (Lazy predict)
          7- Build neural network 
          8- test models

<p> Best Accuresy I have reached = 0.75169 </p>
